      "3The Power of Compounders We believe that the strong relationship between a company™s \n",
      "˜nancial productivity and its carbon footprint can be explained \n",
      "by the company™s asset intensity. Companies with the lowest \n",
      "levels of ˜nancial productivity tend to have higher levels of \n",
      "capital intensity (i.e., relatively more ˜xed assets on their balance \n",
      "sheet). ˚e operation of these ˜xed assets, in particular plants and \n",
      "equipment, generally results in relatively high carbon emissions. \n",
      "Conversely, companies with the highest levels of ˜nancial \n",
      "productivity tend to have low capital intensity and this often \n",
      "means that they also have relatively clean environmental pro˜les.\n",
      "Based on our investment criteria, we ˜nd few companies in \n",
      "asset-heavy sectors, such as oil, utilities, and infrastructure that \n",
      "can sustain high levels of ˜nancial productivity either due to \n",
      "the commoditised nature of their products or services or due to \n",
      "regulations that are often designed to limit the allowable returns.\n",
      "Asset-heavy businesses often have vertically integrated operations \n",
      "and a high level of physical assets on their balance sheet, so \n",
      "while they may have greater control over their supply chain \n",
      "and distribution, generating a strong return on assets could \n",
      "be challenging. ˚is is because asset bases tend to be costly, \n",
      "resulting in a longer utilisation period to achieve returns on \n",
      "those assets. High upfront costs also means these companies \n",
      "have greater di˙culty in gaining scale.\n",
      "Conversely, asset-light businesses tend to be more adaptable \n",
      "to changing market conditions and are usually easily scaled. In \n",
      "addition, they generally have lower operating costs and a stronger \n",
      "focus on innovation and brand building, resulting in relatively \n",
      "heavier investment in technology, research and development, and \n",
      "marketing. ˚is creates sustainable competitive advantages, which \n",
      "is critical to a business not only generating high levels of ˜nancial \n",
      "productivity, but also sustaining it.\n",
      "Additionally, companies with strong governance should create \n",
      "value for shareholders and investors over the long term as \n",
      "strong corporate governance tends to increase management™s \n",
      "accountability and transparency and reduce excessive risk-\n",

      "and increase returns on assets over the long term. ˚is is one \n",
